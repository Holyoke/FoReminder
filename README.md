# Remindux

This is a Rails 5/React-Redux application to demonstrate the latest technologies and practices I've experienced thus far in my career.

# Technologies
Rails 5 for an API back-end, using [devise token auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth) for a single token Devise authentication.

React/Redux for the front-end, and using [jToker](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/j-toker) in concert with the back-end auth.

[Rspec Api Documentation](https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation) for API acceptance tests and documentation.

# Next Steps

Currently looking to implement...

- a Drag and Drop sort with lists, reminders, and comments. There are variety of npm packages to explore for this.

- Image/Screenshot upload with `carrierwave` and `minimagick`.

- Integration testing that incorporates a Rails 5 / Redux setup.

- HTML5 web notifications
